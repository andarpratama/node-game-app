# node-game-app

Organized and Develop by [Andar Pratama](https://www.instagram.com/andar.pratama_/).

## Description

I made this project when I was still studying at one of the Fullstack Javascript Bootcamps. In this Bootcamp, our students are required to work on 4 different projects, both Frontend and Backend.
For this project, this is the second project. We are required to create a simple game project that is only Server-Side. Broadly speaking here I use Node, Express, MongoDB and others.
